                <div id="about-dialog" title="About Me" style="display: none;">
                    <p>I am a computer programmer in Portland, Oregon.  I studied coding at
                    PDX Code Guild and writing and religion at the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies
                    at the University of Redlands.</p>
                    <p>We believe in being stewards of the earth, living modestly.  We support the local
                    economy as much as possible, and local farms through CSA shares.  My wife and I built our own
                    tiny home on a trailer that we lived in for two years.  We recently moved out when our son
                    started walking.</p>
                    <p>I am a cowboy poet, with dreams of being free in all aspects of life.  In my mind there is a
                    picture of a small family farm, with a creek running through, my wife tending her
                    garden and our son playing in the fields and trees.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy reading and writing, coding, a friendly game of cards, taking my son to the pool,
                    going to big movie premiers, and having a drink with a good friend.</p>

                <div id="cover-letter-dialog" title="Cover Letter" style="display: none;">
                    <p>Dear Azure Standard Human Resources Team,</p>
                    <p>I would like to submit this letter and accompanying r&#233sum&#233
                    for consideration as application for the Technical Project Manager position with Azure Standard.
                    I have several years of experience in management and logistics, and I've made a career move
                    into the technology industry beginning with an education and training in computer programming.</p>
                    <p>I am a graduate and current active member of PDX Code Guild, a Portland, OR based
                    coding school with an emphasis on Python, Django, JavaScript, SQL, HTML5 & CSS3.  The
                    school inspired me to keep on learning and creating, and I have been actively continuing
                    to grow as a programmer since graduating at the end of February.  Two of my greatest passions
                    are building things and being surrounded by potent creative energy.  That is one of the reasons
                    I am interested in taking my management background and making it a part of my move into the tech
                    sector.</p>
                    <p>There are several reasons I would be an ideal candidate for the Technical Project Manager
                    position.  First, on the technical side, I have a solid foundation in several of the core
                    technologies & platforms your company already uses, and my experience has shown that I am
                    more than capable of picking up new ones quickly as needed.  Second, my experience as a team
                    leader and manager in logistics and warehousing shows that I will have an ability to
                    communicate with both internal and external clients for the technical projects I would be
                    managing.  Since warehousing and distribution is a large part of what Azure does, my background would
                    allow me to quickly grasp many of the problems you face and help develop solutions for them.  Finally,
                    and perhaps most important, my family's values align strongly with Azure Standard's mission.</p>
                    <p>I live in Portland with my wife and son, and I would be more than happy to commute
                    to work on site a couple days a week as the job requires.  Thank you very much for your
                    time and consideration.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
                    <p>David G. Knox, Jr.</p>
